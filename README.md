Youjo Senki: Birth of an Empire Ver. 0.4 "Gran Reino".

Commentary from Regentess Ryona, one of the mod makers:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Hello to those that have downloaded this mod and glory to the Empire!
This Victoria II mod at the time of it's creation was already well aware of VIctoria III's development. 
However we had decided to make this mod out of being fans of the show Youjo Senki and fans of Paradox Interactive games.
Since Youjo Senki to my knowledge of the lore barely has any information prior to when Tanya was born, we felt like of all games
Victoria II would be the best candidate to achieve this as we wouldn't have to come up with as much crazy lore for EUIV's timeline
or dynamic family systems of Crusader Kings. 

This version of the mod is more suited for multiplayer, so The Empire will be nerfed to compensate the lands The Empire acquires by the First World War.
This is to give the rest of the powers more of a fighting chance against what would be a super Germany in Vanilla Vic2.
Keep in mind that a decent Empire player will still be able to crush powers like the Francois Republic with ease in a 1v1 scenario.

Currently right now this mod is still in the works with it currently being a slightly modified Vanilla experience.

So when this mod officially becomes finished, it will be our interpretation of the lore that led up to Tanya's birth and afterwards.

I hope to those who read this and play this mod will enjoy.
