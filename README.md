Youjo Senki: Birth of an Empire Ver. 0.2 "Fjord".

Commentary from Regentess Ryona, one of the mod makers:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Hello to those that have downloaded this mod and glory to the Empire!
This Victoria II mod at the time of it's creation was already well aware of VIctoria III's development. 
However we had decided to make this mod out of being fans of the show Youjo Senki and fans of Paradox Interactive games.
Since Youjo Senki to my knowledge of the lore barely has any information prior to when Tanya was born, we felt like of all games
Victoria II would be the best candidate to achieve this as we wouldn't have to come up with as much crazy lore for EUIV's timeline
or dynamic family systems of Crusader Kings.

I hope to those who read this and play this mod will enjoy.

Changelog:
